# Expanding Cards
My version of expanding cards project from 50 projects in 50 days Udemy's course. 

Visit https://lukhasdeveloper.github.io/expanding-cards to see it running.


Difference between mine code and the structor code: 
- Most functional and clean code architecture. 
- CSS reactivity for mobile devices.

Run it on live-server or lite-server and enjoy. :smile:
